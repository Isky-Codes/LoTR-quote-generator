![Project Screenshot](https://github.com/Isky-Codes/LoTR-quote-generator/blob/main/Screenshot.PNG)

A repository to hold a very simple CRUD app based on users favourite quotes from Lord of the Rings. Users are able to add their personal favourite quotes, have their quotes list 'invaded' by the Witch King and can remove quotes from the Witch King.

# How It's Made: 
Stack Used: HTML, CSS, JS

# Optimization:

Aim to add quote removal function to remove quotes from the list.

# Lessons Learned: 
As this was my first attempt at a CRUD app I have learned:

- Different CRUD methods.
- How to use GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
- Setting up NODE.JS and modules
- How to connect to a MongoDB database
- Basic MongoDB methods (adding, removing, updating documents in a collection)
